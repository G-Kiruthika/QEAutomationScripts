Validation Results and Quality Metrics:
- Coverage: 100% of Jira story acceptance criteria covered, with additional boundary and negative tests.
- Redundancy: No redundant scenarios; each covers a unique aspect of registration.
- Traceability: Each scenario is mapped to explicit acceptance criteria.
- Gaps: There is NO user registration endpoint defined in the provided Swagger/OpenAPI contract ('ecommerce_swagger.json'). The API contract does NOT cover the requirements for user registration. This is a critical gap: tests cannot be automated or executed until the endpoint is defined.
- QA Standards: All scenarios are precise, actionable, and traceable to requirements, supporting both functional and security validation.
Recommendation: Update the Swagger/OpenAPI specification to include a user registration endpoint conforming to these scenarios and acceptance criteria.
